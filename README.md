Notes:

The application version is stable and working fine.
Theres no Aspose lib integration for now in this project.

How the project works for now:
1) The project only expose some API endpoints able to receive a single file or multiple files
2) these files get uplaoded in the app via Swagger API endpoint
3) files are read and stored in a LOCALDB
4) you can choose which file yyou can downlaod using the specific API endpoint by submitting a post request with the specific file ID

Missing or partial functionalities:
- the final part where the file get uplaoded in a specific Sharepoint folder is partially integrated, but not completed.
