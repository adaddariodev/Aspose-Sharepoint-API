üìí Notes:

‚Äº THIS PROJECT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS ‚Äº

The application version available in the MAIN branch is stable and working fine.

How the project works right now:
1) The project expose some API endpoints able to receive a single file or multiple files
2) These files get uplaoded in the app via Swagger API endpoint
3) Files are read and saved in a LOCALDB
4) You can choose which file want to downlaod using the specific API endpoint by submitting a post request with the specific file ID

Missing functionalities (mostly):
0) Aspose library implementation;
1) Create a Excel file;
2) Modify a Excel file;
3) Delete files stored in LOCALDB;

THANKS! üôè
